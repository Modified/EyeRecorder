EyeRecorder Chrome Extension
===========================

This extension was developed for the [EyeWriter](http://eyewriter.org/) but not only :).

The EyeWriter is a low-cost eye tracking system that uses inexpensive cameras and open-source computer vision software to track the wearer's eye movements.

Our extension reduces the number of clicks needed while browsing, by recording and saving the navigation once and then easily choosing and repeating them.
